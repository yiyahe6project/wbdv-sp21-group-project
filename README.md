## Project Overview
- **App: Online Shopping Application for Drinks** 

- **Summary**

  We build a web application for all cocktail lovers! Here, not only can you purchase your favorite drinks, but also register as seller and create your own store.
  
- **User Roles**
  - Buyer
  
  - Seller
  
  - Admin
  
- **Overall Strategy**

  We utilize external cocktail APIs to implement some features for our application, such as searching a drink, querying details of drink recipes, etc. The tech stack for the application is **React** framework for frontend, **Node** server for backend to store usersâ€™ personal information and shopping activities, and **mongoDB** for database.
